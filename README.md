## Introduction

This GitHub repository is the codebase for the research paper titled - '**Few-shot Transfer Learning to Improve Chest X-Ray Pathology Detection using limited Triplets**'. The paper discusses about the training of Few-Shot Learning coupled with triplet images to boost the classification of Chest X-Ray Images. The traning method proposed in the paper can be used in rapid re-training oppurtunities for human-in-the-loop systems, where a radiologist can relabel false inferences and the model can be quickly retrained.
